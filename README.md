## ✨ Who I Am
I’m a front-end engineer who believes deeply in **clarity**, **precision**, and **good design**.  
My focus is simple:  
**Write clean code. Build intuitive interfaces. Deliver meaningful experiences.**

I enjoy creating:
- Scalable component architectures  
- Modern UI/UX with micro-interactions  
- Fast, optimized React applications  
- Design-driven features powered by logic

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **Design is not decoration — it’s communication.**  
> **Code is not instructions — it’s a craft.**

I build like a designer, think like an engineer, and polish like an artist.
